Decide between BufferedReader or Scanner to read this txt file. 
Solution: Scanner has more methods and the txt file won't be big enough to realise the better performance of BufferedReader.

WHat is a good design pattern for this program. MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) apparently.

Here are my problems so far with this program.
1.
The task and its components are all being shown on one line extending past the width of the JFrame. 
2.
This in turn makes the program side scroll to view the rest of the task that is beyond the width of the JFrame.
3.
The program isn't able to vertically scroll. I want each individual task to be within their own task panel. All tasks are currently being squished within the height of the JFrame.
4.
I want all the tasks and their contents contained within the width of the jframe and other tasks to extend vertically below the height(beyond the y of the Jframe).
It should only be vertically scrollable.

Now there's another problem of the task description only being able to be displayed within the boundaries of the task panel. 
The task panel doesn't resize.
