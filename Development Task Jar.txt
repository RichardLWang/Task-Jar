Get rid the placeholder n/a for Date Completed. 
I'm guessing if there's a bunch of empty spaces it'll just be part of the String.
It's either empty or has a date. Then move onto the next line for the task description.
If I get rid of n/a means null then how do I know which tasks need completing?
I'm just gonna use a -.

Tasks without a Date Completed should be sorted to the top. These tasks without a completion date can be sorted via a LIFO(Recent Tasks)/FIFO(Late Tasks) button. 
A JPanel with a flow layout holds the button in the south border of the main panel.

Can the fields of Task be expanded? It might just be best to keep it simple for now. Incorporating something like the builder pattern would make Task Jar too complex and beyond the idea of a simple jar.

Font size should be made a variable so that the size of the description area can be multipled by it so that the description can fit in the box.
Maybe I can use width and height keywords like in Processing.

Reversed the order tasks within the txt file so that upon opening the txt file the most recent tasks will be at the top instead of at the bottom. 
Also alleviates the problem of completed tasks from aons ago being the first thing one sees. This is how I should have done my DONE.txt list instead of always scrolling down to add completed tasks.

Now there's another problem of the task description only being able to be displayed within the boundaries of the task panel. 
The task panel doesn't resize.
Solution: Narrowed it down to descriptionArea.setPreferredSize and put in a min condition and a formula. The formula doesn't account for really packed descriptions as they will have a bigger space below.

Here are my problems so far with this program.
1.
The task and its components are all being shown on one line extending past the width of the JFrame. 
2.
This in turn makes the program side scroll to view the rest of the task that is beyond the width of the JFrame.
3.
The program isn't able to vertically scroll. I want each individual task to be within their own task panel. All tasks are currently being squished within the height of the JFrame.
4.
I want all the tasks and their contents contained within the width of the jframe and other tasks to extend vertically below the height(beyond the y of the Jframe).
It should only be vertically scrollable.

WHat is a good design pattern for this program. MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) apparently.

What is the difference between a .txt and a .data file.

Decide between BufferedReader or Scanner to read this txt file. 
Solution: Scanner has more methods and the txt file won't be big enough to realise the better performance of BufferedReader.

Decide what can denote the null value for the Date Completed field. n/a is too hard to type out.
