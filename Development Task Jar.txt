WHat is a good design pattern for this program. MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) apparently.

Font size should be made a variable so that the size of the description area can be multipled by it so that the description can fit in the box.
Maybe I can use width and height keywords like in Processing.

Tasks without a Date Completed should be sorted to the top. These tasks without a completion date can be sorted via a LIFO (Recent Tasks) / FIFO (Late Tasks) button. 
The uncompleted tasks should be sorted by date. 
A JPanel with a flow layout holds the button in the south border of the main panel.

22-1-2025 [Coding] -
Checkbox for task completion to be placed on the top right of the task panel.
Upon clicking it a completion date will be generated for the task.
Completed tasks should get their backgrounds coloured.

- Look at the structure of MileStone 2 and adapt to my Task Catergory Counter program
- Creating Task Jar will allow me to see my progress. The TaskListModel class will allow for these manipulations.

Figure out how to start editing tasks. Checkbox for completion and task description edit. Why is the area of this task so big?

28-1-2025 [Coding] -
Task description editing is not to my liking.
The area is not expanding down as I type so I can't see what I'm typing on the lines further down.

28-1-2025 [Coding] -
The tasks within the txt file are being saved by the order of the FIFO/LIFO button. I don't think it should be saved like this for performance reasons.

31-1-2025 [Coding] -
I want task editing to be locked to one task until the task save button is hit.

Restructure task meta data into new format:
31-1-2025 [Coding] - 1706729400000 -
Task description here
31-1-2025 [Coding] - 1706729400000 -
Task description here
31-1-2025 [Coding] - 1706729400000 -
Task description here

Create a new empty task with the new task button.
It will consist of a date that is generated + a String consisting of " [] -".
Followed by a new line.
This new task will be inserted at the top of the txt file. 
I learnt that computers read data like a scroll. From top to bottom. 
Computers will read data sequentially similar to the early days of computing with rolls of punch cards. 
It's basically much faster to append to the bottom and just display it in my program with the tasks in reverse.

6-2-2025 [Coding] -
I don't think saving from TaskListPanel should be necessary. 

6-2-2025 [Coding] -
I can't edit a new task because saveTaskChanges seems to overwrite the txt file with a previous copy of the taskModel I think.

6-2-2025 [Coding] -
Patience. I wonder if this program is any slower on my home PC because the Macbook is way faster.

How to create a new task:
Upon hitting the new Task button of TaskListPanel.
A new task is created with default values.
It is put into a task panel that is then added to the mainPanel.
This task is then saved to both the taskModel and the txt file.
The mainPanel is then refreshed to display it.

4-2-2025 [Coding] 4-2-2025
The identifying data for the tasks should only be read from the first line.
It should only look for the meta data after an empty line and stop after the first line has been processed until an empty line is reached.

I've run into the dilemma of wanting every task to have a unique primary identifier. I've been recommended a Unix timestamp. 
I reckon I should change the date completed to a unix timestamp. At this point I think this txt file might start becoming not human readable.
It would be good to have these Unix timestamps because they can be used in the future indicate at which times tasks are created and completed.
This looks good: 31-1-2025 [Coding] - <created:1706729400000> <completed:->
Task description here.
NAH I'm gonna be using 24 hour time. I still want the txt to be human readable or maybe I can keep using unix timestamps alongside 24hour?

What is Java GUI. How to make it look like a smart phone app. It already looks the part. 
Actually taking it to a smartphone would be next level. 
Just check this task off when you accomplish I can't see beyond the inital text boxxxx argh. 
I'm typing th e blind. Word wrap causes any written text to be written on one line. Not really much of a problem since most txt editors can do horizontal word wrap.

How are tasks saved?
1. descriptionArea has a mouse listener to see if the JTextArea is editable.
2. The descriptionArea is set to be editable and the background colour changed to indicate that. The save button also appears. 
3. Clicking off the descriptionArea or clicking the save button will trigger the saveTaskChanges() function. 
4. I've discovered that the writeTasks() function completely overwrites the txt file with the copy from TaskListPanel. 
I can't believe I dived this deep and finally the notion of having a unique primary identifier popped into my head as there's no way each task can be identified.

There is an issue of sorting the 8-1-2025 good design pattern task. 
Solution was that the date format wasn't consistent.

22-1-2025 [Coding] 22-1-2025
Figure out how to sort the tasks by date completed by getting a list. The panel will have to be refreshed everytime task order button is hit.

15-1-2025 [Coding] 15-1-2025
Get rid the placeholder n/a for Date Completed. 
I'm guessing if there's a bunch of empty spaces it'll just be part of the String.
It's either empty or has a date. Then move onto the next line for the task description.
If I get rid of n/a means null then how do I know which tasks need completing?
I'm just gonna use a -. It shouldn't be followed by anything else like a space. Otherwise date completed won't be read as null.

15-1-2025 [Coding] 15-1-2025
Can the fields of Task be expanded? It might just be best to keep it simple for now. Incorporating something like the builder pattern would make Task Jar too complex and beyond the idea of a simple jar.

Reversed the order tasks within the txt file so that upon opening the txt file the most recent tasks will be at the top instead of at the bottom. 
Also alleviates the problem of completed tasks from aons ago being the first thing one sees. This is how I should have done my DONE.txt list instead of always scrolling down to add completed tasks.

8-1-2025 [Coding] 9-1-2025
Now there's another problem of the task description only being able to be displayed within the boundaries of the task panel. 
The task panel doesn't resize.
Solution: Narrowed it down to descriptionArea.setPreferredSize and put in a min condition and a formula. The formula doesn't account for really packed descriptions as they will have a bigger space below.

Here are my problems so far with this program.
1.
The task and its components are all being shown on one line extending past the width of the JFrame. 
2.
This in turn makes the program side scroll to view the rest of the task that is beyond the width of the JFrame.
3.
The program isn't able to vertically scroll. I want each individual task to be within their own task panel. All tasks are currently being squished within the height of the JFrame.
4.
I want all the tasks and their contents contained within the width of the jframe and other tasks to extend vertically below the height(beyond the y of the Jframe).
It should only be vertically scrollable.

Decide between BufferedReader or Scanner to read this txt file. 
Solution: Scanner has more methods and the txt file won't be big enough to realise the better performance of BufferedReader.

Decide what can denote the null value for the Date Completed field. n/a is too hard to type out.

Adding new tasks.
At first I thought of adding new tasks to the txt file but to see them I would have to reread the file.
Then I thought of the reverse way so that there's only one file operation. 
I would just create a new Task first then add its task panel to the mainPanel so that it's displayed immediately.
Saving it to the txt file comes later.
